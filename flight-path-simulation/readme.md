# Simulating Coronavirus Outbreak Using Flight Networks and Time

## Concept

Using flight path dataset, build a flight network originating from Wuhan to various destinations. Network characteristics (e.g. nodes, paths, edges) in addition to time become predictors for cases and deaths at terminal destinations. 

## Dataset

* Flight Paths From Wuhan (Source: Open Flights)
* Time-series of Wuhan Outbreak
